grub-dd
=======
This ISO contains a version of grub that was extended with a "dd" command that
can write data from raw images (as created by "dd") and ntfs-images (as
created by "ntfsclone --save-image") to the disk.

Grub transparently recognizes and decrompresses .gz and .xz archives. For
.xz it must be compressed with "--check=crc32".

!!! CAUTION! Writing to the wrong device will wipe out your data! !!!

Typical steps:
==============

Load your keyboard layout:

 loadkeys de

List information about the disks:

 lsblk

Prepare partition table with "cfcidsk" or any other partitioning tool.

Create filesystem for images (assuming it will be on /dev/sda2):

 mkfs.ext2 -L images /dev/sda2

or if a windows installation should have access to it:

 mkfs.ntfs -f -L images /dev/sda2

Install grub on /dev/sda and store its configuration files on /dev/sda2:

 mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
 grub-install --boot-directory /mnt/boot /dev/sda

Edit /mnt/boot/grub/grub.cfg to boot a windows installation on the first
partition of the first disk (use "nano" as editor if you have no other
preference). See "grub.cfg.sample" for an example.

For details see "info grub" -> Configuration -> Multi-boot manual config.


Restoring a NTFS partition from an image before it gets booted
==============================================================

This exmaple makes the following assumtions:
 - the NTFS partition in question is the first one on the
   first disk ("(hd0,msdos1)" for grub, "/dev/sda1" for linux).
 - images are stored on the second partition ("(hd0,msdos2)" for grub,
   "/dev/sda2" for linux).

Create images of a ntfs partition:

 mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
 ntfsclone --save-image -o - /dev/sda1 | gzip -c > /mnt/my.ntfsclone.gz

!!! CAUTION! Be careful! Be sure to use the correct target partition!
    Any mistake might wipe out your disk!

To restore an image to the first partition of the first disk on boot insert
the following line int to the menuentry:

 dd --ntfs (hd0,msdos2)/my.ntfsclone.gz (hd0,msdos1)

See "grub.cfg.sample" for an example.
